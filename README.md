# BioComputation

This file consist of three main parts :
1. get_all_possible_functions() - This function receives all possible functions with #conditions. Since we have 9 different conditions, this will return with 2^9=256 different functions
2. find_monotonic_functions(all_functions) - This function finds all monotonic functions out of possible functions
3. print_output_table(monotonic_functions) - Print in a neet way all monotonic functions
